  <h1>AgriOcean Dspace copyright policy</h1>

  <p>In self-archiving this collection of files and associated bibliographic metadata, the author (or the person who is responsible for the submission) grants an AgriOcean Dspace Repository the right to store them and make them permanently available publicly for free on-line. This material has to be his own intellectual property. An AgriOcean Dspace Repository does not assume any responsibility if there is any breach of copyright in distributing these files or metadata. All authors are urged to prominently assert their copyright on the title page of their work.</p>

  <h2>Authors's Copyright</h2>

  <p>Submitting a work to an AgriOcean Dspace Repository  does not affect the copyright of the work. When you submit a preprint to an e-prints server, you retain copyright. Texts that an author has himself written are his own intellectual property. Unless noted otherwise, the creators or authors retain copyright and other proprietary rights. Submitting authors will be responsible for ensuring the documents they archive do not have any restrictions on their electronic distribution. The author holds the copyright for the pre-refereed preprints, so they can be self-archived without seeking anyone else's permission. For the refereed postprint, the author has to verify if the work can be submitted to an open archive or he can try to modify the copyright transfer agreement to allow self-archiving, or, failing that, can append or link a corrigenda file to the already self-archived preprint.  It is suggested to add a Creative Commons license to control the open access to work, where the authors' intention is to hold the copyright.</p>

  <p>The right to self-archive the refereed postprint is a legal matter because the copyright transfer agreement pertains to that text. But the pre-refereed preprint is self-archived at a time when no copyright transfer agreement exists and so the author holds exclusive and full copyright. In general, when you publish in a journal you transfer copyright to the publisher. Most journals permit self-archiving, but it depends on the publisher's copyright policy. Authors can also deposit the postprint inside the archive with restricted access. Authors may request that the publisher give back certain rights, e.g. the right to deposit the postprint in an open access archive, or to put it on your own homepage. Some publishers have stated that they grant these rights as a standard procedure. Copyright law gives the creator of copyrighted work exclusive rights, which may be both segmented and transferred to others. Managing copyright wisely can significantly enhance the values of the educational system.</p>
