 <p>DSpace captures, distributes and preserves digital research products. 
    Here you can find articles, working papers, preprints, technical reports, conference papers 
    and data sets in various digital formats. Content grows daily as new communities 
    and collections are added to DSpace.</p>
<p>The DSpace content is organized 
  around Communities which can correspond to administrative entities such as schools, 
  departments, labs and research centers. Within each community there can be an 
  unlimited number subcommunities and an unlimited number of collections. Each collection 
    may contain an unlimited number of items.</p>

<p><strong>Browse</strong> allows you to go through a list of items in some specified order:</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Community/Collection</strong> takes you through the communities in alphabetical 
order and allows you to see the subcommunities and collections within each community.</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Title</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all titles of items in DSpace.</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Author</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all authors of items in DSpace.</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Subject </strong>allows you to move through an alphabetical list of subjects assigned to items in DSpace.</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Date </strong>allows you to move through a list of all items in DSpace in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p><strong>You may sign on to the system if you:</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>wish to subscribe to a collection and receive e-mail updates when new items are added</li>
  <li>wish to go to the &quot;My DSpace&quot; page that tracks your subscriptions and other interactions with 
    DSpace requiring authorization (if you are a submitter for a collection, for instance.)</li>
  <li>wish to edit your profile</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit</strong> is the DSpace 
  function that enables users to add an item to DSpace. The process of submission 
  includes filling out information about the item on a metadata form and uploading 
  the file(s) comprising the digital item. Each community sets its own submission 
  policy.</p>
<p><strong>My DSpace</strong> is a personal 
  page that is maintained for each member. This page can contain a list of items 
  that are in the submission process for a particular member, or a task list of 
  items that need attention such as editing, reviewing, or checking. In the future 
  this page will also maintain information about personal services offered by 
  DSpace, such as e-mail notification when new items are added to a collection.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Profile</strong> allows 
  you to change your password.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong> takes you to 
  information about the DSpace project and its development.</p>

<p>To search all of DSpace, 
  use the yellow search box at the top of the navigation bar on the left (or the

<p align="center"> <img src="searchtop.gif" alt="Search Box" width="119" height="53" /> 
  </p>
<p> To limit your search to 
  a specific community or collection, navigate to that community or collection

<p align="center"> <img src="searchother.gif" alt="Search Box" width="253" height="69" /></p>
<p>DSpace uses the<strong> Jakarta 
  Lucene </strong>search engine. Here are some search hints:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>What is searched in 
    the general keyword search (yellow box)<br />
    </strong>The word(s) you enter in the search box will be searched against the title, 
    author, subject abstract, series, sponsor and identifier fields of each item's 
    record. </p>
    <p>If your site is enabled for full-text searching, the text you entered will also be
    searched against the full text of all archived documents. For more information on full-text
    searching please contact 
    your <a href="#admin">DSpace Administrator</a>. </p>
  <p><strong>What is not searched 
    - Stop Words<br />
    </strong>The<strong> </strong>search engine ignores certain words that occur frequently in 
    English, but do not add value to the search. These are: </p>
  <p align="center"> "a", "and" 
    , "are" , "as" , "at" , "be" , "but" , "by" , "for" , "if" , "in" , "into", 
    </p>
  <p align="center">"is" ,"it" 
    ,"no" , "not" , "of" , "on" , "or" , "such", "the" , "to" , "was"</p>
  
  <p><strong>Truncation<br />
    </strong>Use an asterisk (*) after a word stem to get all hits having words starting 
    with that root, for example: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search1.gif" alt="" width="75" height="27" />&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      will retrieve selects, selector, selectman, selecting. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stemming <br />
    </strong>The search engine automatically expands words with common endings to include 
    plurals, past tenses ...etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Phrase Searching</strong><br />
    To search using multiple words as a phrase, put quotation marks (&quot;) around 
    the phrase.</p>
  <p><img src="search8.jpg" alt=""  width="196" height="28" /> 
    </p>
  <p><strong>Exact word match</strong><br />
    Put a plus (+) sign before a word if it MUST appear in the search result. 
    For instance, in the following search the word &quot;training&quot; is optional, 
    but the word &quot;dog&quot; must be in the result. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search2.gif" alt=""  width="123" height="27" /></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Eliminate items with 
    unwanted words<br />
    </strong>Put a minus (-) sign before a word if it should not appear in the search 
    results. Alternatively, you can use <strong>NOT</strong>. This can limit your search 
    to eliminate unwanted hits. For instance, in the search</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search3.jpg" alt="" width="124" height="28" /> 
      &nbsp; or &nbsp; <img src="search4.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="28" /></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>you will get items containing 
    the word &quot;training&quot;, except those that also contain the word &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
  <p><strong>Boolean searching</strong></p>
  <p>The following Boolean 
    operators can be used to combine terms. Note that they must be CAPITALIZED 
    !</p>
  <p><strong>AND</strong> - to limit 
    searches to find items containing all words or phrases combined with this 
    operator, e.g.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <img src="search5.jpg" alt="" width="124" height="28" /> 
      will retrieve all items that contain BOTH the words &quot;cats&quot; and 
      &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>OR</strong> - to enlarge 
    searches to find items containing any of the words or phrases surrounding 
    this operator </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search6.jpg" alt="" width="124" height="28" /> 
      will retrieve all items that contain EITHER the words &quot;cats&quot; or 
      &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOT - </strong>to exclude 
    items containing the word following this operator, e.g. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search4.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="28" />will 
      retrieve all items that contain the word &quot;training&quot; EXCEPT those 
      also containing the word &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Parentheses can be used 
    in the search query to group search terms into sets, and operators can then 
    be applied to the whole set, e.g.</p>
  <p><img src="search7.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="28" /> 
    </p>

<p>A controlled vocabulary is a set of terms which form a dictionary of descriptions
of particular types of content or subject matter.  These are maintained by 
standards bodies in order to standardise the way that similar materials are 
categorised in archives.  This aids searching by increasing the likelihood that
the relevant materials will be returned by the user's search.</p>

<p>Filtering the category list will remove from the list any terms which do not
match the filter.  The remaining terms are any category or sub category which
contains the filter term anywhere in the heirarchy.  Expanding each category
will show you which terms (or sub terms) did match the filter.</p>

<p>To search the archive items by the subject category, check as many boxes next
to the categories as necessary, before clicking "Search...".   The search will
return all items that either match the categories selected exactly, or which
are categorised underneath a higher level category.  Clicking on the "+" next
to the category will expand the tree to show you what refinements are available
for your selected category.</p>

  If the format of the file appears in the list offered, click on it and then

<p>After you have uploaded 
  a file, check the information in the table to make sure it is correct. There 
  are two further ways to verify that your files have been uploaded correctly:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Click on the filename. 
    This will download the file in a new browser window, so that you can check 
    the contents. </li>
  <li>Compare the <a href="#checksum">file 
    checksum</a> displayed here with the checksum you calculate. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you're only uploading 
  one file</strong>, click on "Next" when you're happy that the file has been uploaded 
  correctly.</p>
<p><strong>If you're uploading more 
  than one file</strong>, click on the &quot;Add Another File&quot; button (this will appear 
if you checked "The item consists of more than one file" on the "Submit: Describe Your Item" page). When you 
  are satisfied that all files for this item have been successfully uploaded, 
  click on the &quot;Next&quot; button. </p>
  <p><strong><a name="HTML"></a>If you're uploading an HTML page with embedded files</strong>,
  click on the &quot;Add Another File&quot; button, and upload all files or bitstreams referenced
  in the html page. After all the are uploaded, in the column marked &quot;Primary Bitstream&quot;, 
    select the bitstream or file that is the index page or the top page for the web page. 
    This will ensure that all of your embedded files will display properly on the HTML page. 
  Then click on the &quot;Next&quot; button.</p>

<p><strong><a name="checksum"></a> 
  Checksums </strong></p>
<p>DSpace generates an MD5 
  checksum for every file it stores; we use this checksum internally to verify 
  the integrity of files over time (a file's checksum shouldn't change). You can 
  use this checksum to be sure what we've received is indeed the file you've uploaded.</p>
<p>If you wish to verify the file using checksums, click "Show 
  checksums" on the "Uploaded File" page. The DSpace-generated MD5 checksum for 
  every file we've received from you will show to the right of the filename. You will 
  then need to use a local program to generate your own checksum for these files, 
  and verify that your results match ours. On most UNIX-like systems (including Mac OS X), 
  use md5sum. For instance, type "md5sum MYFILE" for every file you want to check; 
  the summary should print on your screen. For Windows machines, MD5 
  tools are freely available: try md5 (from <a 
  href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/</a>), or md5sum, 
  available via the textutils package in Cygwin (<a 
  href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>). All of these utilities will 
  need to be run from a command-line, or terminal, window. The entire digest printed 
  out when you run the md5 tool on your local copy of the file you're uploading 
  should be exactly equal to what DSpace reports.</p>
